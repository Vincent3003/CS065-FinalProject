# CS065-FinalProject
  This project is about how much people can earn based on their gender and race in the Private work class in America. The reason why I did this report is that many people wonder why a woman is the one receiving less in their paycheck, and they think women receive mistreatment in the workplace. I will explain why a salary gap exists between males and females through the bar chart.
 
 Firstly, women tend to have more responsibilities in their lives, such as taking care of their kids, their family, and their appearance. Those things distract them from their working hours, which affect their decisions, the years of experience that affect their faculty rank, and research productivity. Secondly, women tend not to negotiate when it comes to their salaries. However, men do not hesitate to negotiate to get the money. Besides that, women do not believe they can negotiate their salary successfully because they are not confident in their abilities, which makes everyone think men are the breadwinners in the family. Finally, women can face some difficulties in engineering and medical fields because they will need to spend more time to practice than their personal life. In case of women have a family, they need to balance their perosnal life and work-life.
 
 I wrote the code because I wanted to be more familiar with Python. I had no experience in coding, and this project is my first coding project during my freshman college year.
